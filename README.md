# Tip-Calculator
This application is used to calculate the amount of tip based on original bills and the selected tip percentage. From following the instructions on CodePath, I added some effects to make it better: 
- Besides the default tip percentages of 15%, 18%, 20%, user can also choose another tip percentage by clicking "Other", and tip slider will appear. 
- User can also choose the party size to divide the amount of tip and total among the total number of people. 
- There is a setting screen where user can change to "Night Mode" by sliding a switch
